had said to MRST also earlier

12/14/18, 2:30 PM - Romi) Ramgaria Barc: Volatility:

Since the NCC$ could charge with the change of just one durable, i: was highly

volatile

NCCS of MMe changed between the time the UE study / Listing exercise was

conducted and approaching thea for empanelment

More critically, empanelied HHs changed NCCS &€“ which has potent-al to create

assues with the panel

This volatility was moat apparent in the lower MCCS which were upgrading as

durable ownership became more accessible to people across the spectrum

Social Classification:

Over time, MCCS vas beconing increasingly less discriminatory in tecms of
O viewership. Certain &€*niches€™ groups of genres or channel types (e.g. English,

HD, Business etc.) were 4€-democraticae™ in terms of viewing patterns across |

NCCS. This cemonstrated that discrimination on social parameters was weakening .

As @ resu:t, the system was less efficiens for use by stakeholders to make .

adequate programming or advertising decisions ,

The grapevine is that Unien Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari gave media baron
Subhash Chandra the cold shoulder recently. 1t appears that severa: Central road
projects awarded to Chandraa€™s Essel Infraprojects were executed shoddily. When ‘
Chandra went to meet Gadkazi to resolve the issue, the Minister not only made
him wait for an hour-and-a-half outside his office, but also warned of
confiscating Essel Infraprojectsée™ bank guarantee money, if it did not mend its
ways. Gadkari apparently hes given a three-month notice to Essel to implement
road projects to the satisfaction of his department or face action.

Order taking effect, BARC india will continue to release viewership ratings on
every Thursday to subscribers.
However given the changes taking place on ground the viewership numbers will be
volatile and unpredictable. So BARC Indie will temporarily stop publishing
viewership numbers to the press and public domain (Website, App, Heads-up, Alpha
Club , Kids report, etc) for the transition period till the situation on ground
settles down. This will be effective from Week 6 onwards.
During this period, BARC India will also not be able to enswer questions on
changes in viewership trends during thas transition period.
Also attached is the BARC nav ee aT to the New Tariff order.

expensive option.
b) Incorporate the JV - JV will focus on meter develcopaent, products and playout
monitoring. While incorporating the JV, we can incorporate obligation clauses
which restricts Sensara from doing conpeting products for any other entity even
through ite main entity. BARC WiJl have a controlling stake in this JV. The JV .
ry can incorporate restrictions on Sensara for areas which ere of strategic
~ interest to BARC.

monitoring ard ratings monetization related products.

6/26/19, $:47 PM - PDGAO: India tv is never affected. You know wha: they do.
Their outliers aren't outiiers. Tv 16 has no content but they are big guys so
can’t be touched. Ajtek can't be touched because shit will hit the ceiling if
they do. Republic obviously are small players. I guess that’s the view.
6/26/19, 5:47 PM - POGAO: The entire Hindi audience shook because of Bihar. To
say the channel that led it will fall -s out of the question. Tf landing
outliers are mainteined then on what content basis is tv18 going up.

is lowest in genre, but TSV of other channels are higher. (E.g. zee Mews
commercial inventory is 15.5 mins/hr & Republic Bharat is 12.7 mins/Hr but TSV
on Zee News is 15.4 mins and Republic Bharat is 14.16 mins!

impact is extremely obvious. Time bands and landing markets. Can show this to |
you and romil. Please run the outlier for them as well effectively. It's not \
fair to give them this leevay in Hindi. They have don’t no progrerming to jump
up unnatoura-ly.
“\ 6/27/19, 10:05 AM - PDGMO: No sir not effectively. 1. There is no content
rationale behind their jump 2. This haz been accompanied by their landing in
their networks. 3. Makes all my efforts fruitless and utterly pointless now on.
6/27/19, 10:08 AM - PDGAC: If this kind of rationalisacion of landing benefits
tv 10 then what am I fighting for anyway

6/27/19, $:3C PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: ABP News has dropped simila: to Genre
compared to previous wees however the drop is higher compared to PSWA due to
higher increase during election results. ABP’s FCT has been the highest in the
last two weeks. Higher SOD to cricket which has a lower yield. Story coverage to
oO Encephalitis in Bihar was also given lesser focus. Other important stories such |
as Triple Taleq bill, Doctors strike in WB were also given lesser wtg. :
6/27/19, 5:30 PM - Romi! Ramqaria Barc: 1. In wk 21 (election week) ABP had
grown at higher rate than others; Consequently it deciined more in following
weeks. .
2. ABP's ATS has been low compared to other top channels
3. In HSM Rural, ABP performs well. In HSH Urban, the channel is rot so strong.
4. In HSM Urban, they have low exclusive viewers {compared to other top
channels)
$. Recently cheic major focus have been on sports: while [CC cricket world cup ’
on news, haa not really worked #0 vell till wk 24. (only aaj tak and ABP have
spent money on cricket celebrities and have special 3) minute programming).

should be able to repay the entire debt by Sept-19. Mgmt has non-binding

agreements. On the road-asset, # leading investor is looking at this; S$) The tax

leakege in this transaction will be very miniscule and a large part of this .

transaction should come into the hands of the promoters; 6) Promoter stake sale

post transaction could be well below 25% but mgmt believes that promoters would

be motivated to continue to work like pefores 7) A lot has changed since it was

decided in Nov-16 to get # strategic partner. The priority from a business

perspective for tech expertise is still relevant. Mgmt may look at strategic

alliances in the future for this (not necessarily a strategic partner). '

Post the deal, some neer-tem liquidity concerns reduce but in the extremely

competitive OTT (over-the-top) market, we see risks of Zee to losing serket {

share to players like Hozstar, Amazon Prime, Metflix etc over the longer term.

growth is capped basis the previous 4 weeks average. In case the growth of the
channel is across markets or if multiple channels in the Genre also grow then
the treatmert is not applied as the reach growth can be attributed to breaking
news/special events.

serious issue. (Anonymous users ‘bombing’ Zoom meetings with pornographic or
other offensive content.)

As the article states:

Q “On zoom, there is a default setting thet allows any reeting participant to :
share their acreen without permission from an eventée™s host. Anyone who has a '
link to a public meeting can join. Links to public Zooms are traded in Facebook
Groups and Oiscord chats, and are easi-y discoverable on Twitter and public
event peges. ‘
S€utte have been deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of
attack. For those hosting large, public group meetings, we strongly encourage
hosts to change their setzings so that only they can share their screen. For :
those hostirg private meetings, password protections are on by default and we |
recommand that users keep those proteczions on to prevent uninvited users from
Joining, &€* said a spokesperson for Zoom Video Communications in a statement. |
The post included tips for users seeking to a@ekeep =he party crastersi€s out of
their videoconferences, including limiting screen-sharing to certain
participants and ae Sar be ees

collection and processing would bring in new technolegies, new research
methodologies, new methods in analysis, new and better ways to ensure better
data quality.
3.10 BARC should be at ar armd@™s length from its own subsidiary, Meterology .
Data Pvt Ltd., which ie the sole dats collecting agency for BARC, as of now; s0
that the entire process of measurement is carried out independently to ensure
inherent checks in date inconsistency, i.e., there should be s clear demarcation
of the roles between the data collection agency and the dats
processing/publishing agency. '
3.11 Efforta may be made to withhold the identity of the channela¢™s name, and '
number, while collecting and processing the data from the field to bring more
transparency in the complete process. |
36
3.12 BARC should also separate its functions in two units (a) one unit should be |
responsible for prescribing methodology of ratings/validation of data,
publishing the data and eudit mechanism ard (b) the other unit. for processing
~ the data, watermarking or any other such technical work including management of
( ) Gata collection agencies. 1
- 3.13 once multiple agencies come forward for rating, BARC should limit its role
to publishing the ratings, and framing methodology and audit mechanism for the
rating agencies, so that the number of agencies can develop multiple rating
system leveraging new technologies.
3.14 The rating agency should be mandated to increase the sample size from the
existing 44,000 to 60,000 by the end of 2020, and 1,00,000 by the end of 2022
using the existing technology.
3.15 BARC shall immediately conduct a study in collaboration with the Indian
Statistical Institute or any other institute of repute, to estimate the
appropriate sample size, and to get the correct representation of the viewership
including regional and niche channels. Sample size once increased; it will make
the data tampering an arduous exercise. On the basis of the study conducted,
BARC should reach the target of reaching the sample size in @ time-bound manner.
3.16 There should be some financiel disincentives preacribed as penal provisiors
including the cancellation of registration, if the specified target is not met
by SARC.
3.17 MIB should amend the DTH License and NSO registration so as to mandate ST2s
capable of transferring viewership data and adoption of RPD technology. This
) transfer of date can be done by establishing # return path/connection from STB \
to the
37 .
remote servers of the Audience Measurement agency. ,
3.18 Anonymized viewership data should be transferred electronicelly to the |
Audience Measurement agency for statistical analysis and Television Rating
purpose. No data from any STB should be transferred to Rating agency without I
explicit consent from the subscribers. |
3.19 DPOs should be allowed to mutually negotiate the terms and conditions for b
sharing the date with Measurement Rating agency within the overall framework
prescribed by TRAI from tise to time. Such framework ahell be prescribed by TRA:
once these recommendations are accepted by NIB.
3.20 BARC should keep al] relevant data such as originel] data (meter- level
data) arising out of the household panel, the date deleted/ignored/not
considered for it, “raglan processed data for TAP rating at least

the subscribers including Broadcasters, advertising agencies, and advertisers.
3.21 BARC should review/frame its outlier policy based on scientific study and .
market survey conducted from time to time. SARC should eutomate data processing
jim auch @ manner that no manual intervention is required before the final TRE
rating is released. Any type of manual intervention in the meter-level /raw data
arising out of household panel must be avoided. Manual intervention, if any, in
abnormal circumstances should be reported and informed to the auditors also.
3.22 Adequate framework for grievance redreasa! may be made having nodal ‘
officers and Appellate body so that the grievances) of stakeholders can be
effectively addressed in a time-bound manner. BARC should also develop a portal
wherein any |
38
stakeholder can raise the grievance(s) with regards so ratings published by the 1
agency.
3.23 BARC should get annual audit conducted by an independent agency to ensure
conformance with TRP rating methodology, semple size, and grievance redreasal
- methodology and publish the audit report on their website after the Boardse™s 1
“ approval within three months, after the end of the financial year. An audit
manual should be made to ensure accuracy of the process adopted for ratings,

who have or are considering investing overseas .
1, What is better - investing in overseas funds / FOFs or get hold of a
portfolio manager with global reach | like Citi ) who will construct a '
portfolie of 5 -10 scrips. Every Indser. citizen can invest overseas usp 250000
per year / 80 a family of 4 can invest upto USD 1 million ( approx Res 7.5 cre}.
What kind of return in rupee terms car, be expected ,

caps) is hasmered, should one put money in Indian equities or overseas }
stocks.

2. However in contrast the BSE index holds greater progise going forward. So T
would opt for option 2 above, given that there is no broad based rally that has
occurred yet. .
3. To compare the 2 options above we wi:l need to look at a sector specific
index like IT and even with that we will need to be stock specific to look at
Cloud based software stocks on either country to establish a like to like
comparison. In short, be an active investor and if possible engage in stock
selection yourself rather than relying on fund managers, whether ‘t be WASDAQ or
BSE. .
4. Costs of investing overseas are unknown to the Indian investor like forex
conversion costs, currency appreciation ( Ing vs USD, due for correction), fund
agat fees, ate.which will eat into potential returns.
S. In summary , invest directly in individual stocks which are sector and theme
based and avoid indices which are passive investments, for better returns...my 2
cents worth!

shouldn't 1 get the transfer now? What is the correct interpretation
\ $/16/20, 10:43 AM - Romtl Ramgaria Barc: Sorry forgot to respond. Can be argued
both ways. I think itae™s ok

April 20 then now May 20
5/17/20, 2:48 PM - PDOGAO: Showed my displeasure to him
5/17/20, 2:58 PM - Romil Raugaria Barc: Is it? Ne tod me the figures have
remained same at gross level - he messaged me that some net 61 going out to you
now - and some 20-21 being withheld towards foreclosure and recovery
5/17/20, 2:88 9% - PDGAC: Every time it's different
5/17/20, 2:59 94 - PDGAO: This foreclosure and recovery again is new
5/17/20, 2:59 PM - PDGA®: And some TCS
$/17/20, 2:59 PM - POGAO: Recovery was supposed to oe in November alongwith
transfer of asset
5/17/20, 3:09 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Because they want to take one more firm
opinion on sales tax. Yes bank still not given foreclosure charges. They are
holding back $L towards a.1 this - which to me is ok bose - .
© 3/17/20, 3:00 Pt - Romil Remgaria Barc: Atleast mentelly you vonae™t have a !
liability to pay in now
5/12/20, 3:00 8% - Romi) Ramgaria Sarc: Unlikely if there is no sales tax burden
5/17/20, 3:02 PM - Romil Remgaria Barc: Also if you look at the other way - enl
payment is an outflow of every month but not recovering that every month -
hence should be ok na
5/17/20, 3:02 PM - PDGAO: That's their inefficiency na? Technically I lose
interest on that if I have so be sticky - see I may ce ok with all this but the '‘
fact that numbers change in every iteration buga me - maybe something is wrong
5/17/20, 3:02 PM - PDGAC: Yes but you never know if another calculation will
come then |
5/17/20, 3:92 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Gross level it hasns€™t changed - it
remains seme - but I will double check -
5/17/20, 3:03 PM - POGAO: TCS was not <here in earlier two calculations

5/17/20, 3:03 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: But if foreclosure happens now, means
there will be recovery of 20L from you now and balance payment will happen in
now
$/17/20, 3:03 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Since the difference between foreclosirg .
now and nov is 1-2L you are better off making money in hand
5/17/20, 3:04 PM - POGAG: That's why I may agree to the 20lac being deducted

Many at top BCCL management said that Bose has been pilloried over the scandals
involving his two men TOI executive Diwakar Asthana end his deputy Rajeev .
Deshpande who directly report to him. Bose is likely to continue in his given
role but the company is firm on releasing expensive deadwood like Asthana and
Deshpande to infuse fresh energy .
Apart from them, the incumbent managing editor Rohit Saran has been retained
despite his persistence over personal reasons to quit but will be ina
consulting rele to help the synergies between print and digital editions of .
flagship brands and help the company find ways to monetise them.
A set of 361 items containing recorded tapes of Asthena with screenshots of
social media app exchanges were earlier supplied to top executives of the group
individually as well first family members.
The context of conversations has ranged between favouring NSA moves over
extraditions and Kashmir plans post article 370 while specific instances were
_~, made in his auccessful front page coverages to ensure he overshadowed Union hone
*) minister Agit Shah. In lieu, Asthana its believed 4130 sought help for 11
“ gleuths ard officials working in foreign postings. ,
The conversations, its believed, also range with news plants by Asthana seeking
change of guards in several units of BJP including Delhi, West Bengal and
Himachal Pradesh and discontentment over selection of J P Nadda by Shah as
saffron outfitse™s new cho:ce.
One of the conversation, it is also believed that Asthana sought interference
over an MPA account of a Ghasiabad-based packaging firm facing liquidity crisis
and being given a tender at an IT unit under a top ainistry.
Ite unclear if SCCL management and the fauily is looking to terminate contracts
for both Asthana and Deshpande right away over their ages and scandals but
specific massages were relayed by the esteemed office of Prime Minister between
February 16 and May 7 on Asthansa€™s unvanted involvement in the partyde™s
functioning and change cf portfolios of ministries of trade and commerce, civil
aviation, urban developmen:, steel and external affairs.
oO The executives aiso confirmed that June will be see a third salary cut to align
its skewed As 390-crore monthly expendizure spread disproportionace assets and |
workforce. i
The group has also finalised its decision to terminate el] extensions of ite »
consultants, both above $5 and those with selaries above As 1 crore, while
believing thats imprudent to squander wealth on news collection while focussing
on nurturing inexpensive talent. 1

10/08/20, 7:33 PM - Romil Rangarie Barc: Governance
“™N ’ Wo rotation among board members. The entity is contralied by top
* breadcasters with no easy from amall broadcasters, advertisers and agencies
2) Tech coma chairman continues to be the same from Day 1
31 TRAI had mandated not to give raw level data to any broadcaster, despite
thet raw level data hes been given to a large broadcaster indirectly A€" clear
violation
4) For large broadcasters the fees have come down from 1% to 0.8% over the
period, however small broadcasters fees have increased from 6L to 16 now 4e*
clear motive to financially burden small broadcasteza more. The fees for small
broadcasters almost comes to 38 to 10% of their annual revenues and is
completely unaffordable. It should be same & for 11 broadcasters.
s) There is @ rule that tech comm decision can only be over turned by board
with 75% voting &€* This is farce &€" only on paper and not being followed ac™
Digital measurement green signal, landing page decision etc were completely
driven by large broadcasters only
Process Issues
1) Arbitrary data cuts ssppening in channels a€” there is a discom which was
formed for this purpose. However date cuts happen irrespective of discom |
2 process. This is completely illogical, arbitray end lacks process {
21 TV9 was found tampering in one state 4€* logically control should be put on
the channel after discoe. adjudication. However cese itself was not presented to
discom 4€" =here is a clear bias in process ‘
3) There are channels which are controlled but not presented to the discom 4€"
no process and bias in presenting the cases
4) TV viewing ie arbitrarily inflated 4€° meters that are ok but have not :
watched TV are not considered for reporzing and hence inflating the TV viewing i
artificially )
$) No Universe estimation has happened since 2.5 years &€° this has been duc
to push by large broadcasters to continue to over-report TV homes
6) Meters should not be in the systen which sre older than 4 years as per MIB
guidelines however many homes continue to exist
2 Churn policy was arbitrarily changed and put on the website and no approval
from tech corm was teken aff

6) Big gap in the sample frame as approved by the tech comm Va what is
executed on ground &€" this leads to inaccuracy in ratings
9) Multiple communications to subscrobers on Priza Vu Panel a€" loss product .
of GARC which was to be shut but continues to exist under pressure from one news
channels. This coat in indirectly funded by emall broadcesters
10) OOH neasurement done only for one broadcaster 4€” margins of 2308 - hence
natural inclination there. They also contribute almost 1/3rd of total BARC
revenues across multiple revenue streams {directly and indirectly)
11} Daily data released for only hindi GEC and hindi movies - partiality again .
- why not for other genres if the processes ere automared? Why only available to
broadcasters and why not to agencies/advertisers?
12) Pree data given to one broadcaster for 3H &€™ another broadcaster charged
from day 1 - inclination towards one large broadcaster visible 4€* No
standardisation of pricing elso
Independer.ce Issues
1) All committees exist merely for paper process 4€" the decision making is
‘fully controlied by BARC executives and is not independent
ar 2 Praveen Tripathi whe has been associated with BARC since 2015 as # vendor 1
and continues to be associated is one member of the 2 member commictee &€" big
independence issue
3) Heavy payment done to the oversight committee members who follow the
discretion as required &€* Landing page being case in point when the .
recommendation was to remove the full impact however algorithim was tweaked to
favour the big broadcasters (news and non news)

largest industry association TV news channels representing interests of news I
broadcasters from across the length and breadth of the country, strongly objects
to BARCS€™s statement to pause audience estimates (ratings) of Mevs Channels.
(1) BARC did not consul: the News Broadcasters Federation, before such a
crucial decision, which impacts news broadcasting industry, the single-largest
genre within televisior sector. BARC would not have taken any sucn crucial
decision if it had invo.ved any genre, without consulting GECs menber channels.

(2) BARC meters do not single-out the news genre in its audience measurement
system. If BARC sincerely wants to review and augment its system, it should
pause ratings for all genzes including Generel Entertainment Channels (GEC), .
Sports, Infotainment, Movies, Music, Kids, Youth end Lifestyle.
(3) Information has come cut recently about # channe. which hes been found
quilty of TRP manipuletion and has been fined by BARC Disciplinary Committee.
MBE is shocked that a member of the same channel has been included on the board
of BARC. Its€™s not just conflict of interest and no reasonable decision making '
Process can happen with a person named in ratings manipulations. What has
happened itself is shocking. Mow the matter is in public domain, this individual
on the Board of BARC should voluntarily remove the said executive from the Board .
of Directors for a period of at least ore year.
SeuThe decision is unilateral, one-sided and undemocratic, impacting and .
targeting one single genre within the broadcasting ecosystem, $¢* said R. Jai
Krishna, General-Secretary, and News Broadcasters Federation. S€uThe decision
will severely impact news broedcastera, who have seen a surge in ratings despite
the challenges of a lower-chan-expected economic growth thet has izpected their

to increase their ratings this channe] appeared to have sought help of BARC

figures in Barc with immediate effect.

2/5/19, 3:04 AM - Vikas Aidem: The weekend of 26 January saw Harvest TV4€“a nev
English news channelé€"go live on air in India. Its honeymoon period was short-
lived. Just two days later, a few hours into the first business day after the
channelé€™s Launch, Narvest TV briefly disappeared from airwaves. I: was blacked
out on both the platforms it was available onS€“Airtel&e™s direct-to-home (DTH) .
service and cable platform Den Networks.
The channel reappeared a few minutes later, but on a different, downgraded '
frequency, said Deepak Choudhry, president of Veecon Media and Broadcasting,
Marvest&™s promoters. And ever since, things have beer on « downward spiral.
Harvest Tv&é€"a launch was pegged as an important one in the world of television
news media. A political news channel cumoured to be backed by some politicians
from the Indian Wetionel Congress (18C}, it launched just ahead of the upcoming
7™ general elections. It also marks the television comebacks of veteran journalists
~4 ike Barkha Dutt and Karen Thapar. @ut after only a week of its existence, i
Marvest TV finds itself knee-deep in controversy. It has already received
multiple legsl notices and government complaints. There is a name issue, a logo
problem, an unclear shareholding pattern, and an A€aal.egedé€s asscciation with
Indien Wational Congress (INC) leader Kapil Sibal.
As of 30 January, the company had been served with three notices from the
information and broadcasting (168) minis=ry esking 1: to explain these issues,
as well as another legal notice for unauthorised use of a trademark.A According
to Choudhry, the blackout was the resu.t of the I68 sinistry impreesing on the
channels€™s teleport operator Planetcast Media to revert to Harvest TVie™s
original lower frequency since the channe. did not have permission for the
upgraded one. Planetcast did not respord to The Kenéé™s emailed query.
Harvest TV, cr HTH News as it is called on digital media, comes from Selhi-based
Veecon Media and Broadcasting Private Limited. Incorporated in 2099, Veecon had
totel revenue of Rs 3.8 crore (~$533,900) in FY18 and runs just one other
television channel&€”a Hindu devotional channel called Kaatyayani TV. Odds are
you havende™: heard of Veecon Media. Theyl€™ve barely been a blip on the Indian '
O media radar. Harvest TV was meant to be their moment in the sun. But things ‘
havend€™t panned out as planned.A A :
Rs 660 billion :
The size of the Indian television industry as of 2017, according to a Ficci-EY
report. o
Everything tat Veecon Media has done so far seems rushed. The tising of its b
launch is hardly a surprise. Launching ahead of the 2019 general elections will
give it traction and could serve to belster the general election campaign of the
political party it is rumoured to have cies to. There couldna€™t be a better
time to hit the ground running. But in their eagerness to launch, the channel
and its promoters seem to have circumver.ted various zeguiatory nores. Shortcuts
that could prove to be Harvest&€™s undoing.

‘Chat With Vikas Aidem
Given Harvestat™s alleged political affiliation, its promoters would surely have
known that the channel would come under fire from authorities if anything vas .
out of line. Despite this, they chose to game the system. This raises the
queationé€”is Harvest a genuine long-term media play oz a short-term political
one?
Permit politics
Ask any executive in the business and they&€"ll tell you that the hardest part '
about launching a news channel in India is the long and tiresome permission 1
process. You needA permissions end clearances from a* least five different
departments and ministries, and to top it all, there is no legal timeframe that i
governs the process. !
So, based or, the whims and fancies of the departments involved (not to mention :
the political perty in power), the process could take anywhere from. weeks to :
years. Rajeev Chandrasexhar-backed Republic TV, for instance, managed to get all
its permissions sorted within a few weeks. Bloomberg Quint, on the other hand,
CY has been waiting for a licence since 2017.
Starting afresh isn&e™t the only struggle. Permissions are eiso required to
change the name or logo of @ channel or if there is 8 change in the shareholding
or ownership pattern of a company. In all of 2018, the 168 gave 18 permissions,
of which six were news permissions (four to Zee Media Corporetion Ltd. and two
to Bennett Coleman and Company Limited {(BCCL)).

Number of permitted private satellite channels in India, as of 17 December 2016
Bottom line: getting permiasion to run # satellite TV channel is hard. And it
only gets harder when you have ties to the ruling governmenté€™s primary
political ravalsa€“the INC. Rumours of an inC-backed news channe) have been
around since at least early 2018, but it didnae™t see the light of day, likely
because persissions are controlled by the party in power. It should be noted
that while Rajeev Chandrasekhar was an independent Mesber of Parliament at the
time of Republicé€™s launch, he already had overt ties to the ruling BJP
‘\ government and has subsequently become a member of the BJP. 1

With obtaining s TV news channel licence being this difficult, the easier way to

As per RoC filings of the company sourced from bus:ness research platforn
Tofler, Veeconi€"s shareholding has nothing to do with the INC. Despite this,
the word on the street is that it has definite ties to senior INC NP Sibal. ‘
a@mmile it is unclear how Veecon and Kapil Sibal found each other, this channel 4
is certainty Sibalae™s baby. There could be a difference between Zunding and
directorship, 4€* said a senior editor at a rival channe:, who asked not to be
named. A
A Veecon spokesperson den:ed Sibala€™s or, for thet matter, any Congress
leaderae™s involvement in Harvest TV. The spokesperson even vent so far as to
declare that Veecon wee the BJP, albeit &@awith friends on beth sidesé€-.

This, despice Sibal himself claiming that he was trying to set-up and finance
Marvest TV during an appearance at the Jaipur Literature Festival. .
when asked, Choudhry of Veecon Media esid that Sibal&€™s involvement in Veecon
is limited to its marketing and distribution partnership with Analog Media
Private Limited. Sibala¢™s wife, Promila, is the majority shareholder in Analog,
holding a 99.9% atake. According to date sourced from Tofler, the company, which
was formed in October 2017, had revenues of just Re 192 ($2.70) and recorded a ‘
loss of as 2.64 lekh ($3,7€0) in the year ending 31 Narch 2016. Messages and
calls to Kapil Sibal went unanswered.
All eyes on Veecon
The reason for the Sibalsé@™ interest in Veecon is obvious&€"Veecon is the proud
owner of a TV news licence. But what of Veecon itself?
The directors of the company are listed as Jaswant Kunar Srivastava and Lalit
Kumar Srivastava. According to the Veecon Media spokesperson, the two primarily
“run a security systemaade™ business, tried and failed in a music venture, and
~“ have held two TV channel permits from the 16B ministry since 2009.
But despite having these permits, Veeconse™s television business hasnae™t been
anything to write home about. Veecona€™s Kaatyayeni TV has just one
offering&€”live broadcasts of the proceedings at Aadya Retyayanit Chkaterpur
Temple in Delhi. While the S€mAbout Usé¢_ section on the channelée™s website
claims it has a viewership of 60 million, it downgrades that claim to 30 million
in a subsequent paragraph. Choudhry of Veecon clarified that the 69 aillion
number 19 accurate, however, The Ken was unable to independently verify this.
Veecon Mediase™s other channel started life in 2009 as Shri Mewsé€"a Hindi news
channel based in Uttar Pradesh. However, says the Veecon Media spokesperson, the
channel was moved to South India and rechristened Harvest TV in 2016 after it
lost a lot cf money. According to data sourced from Tofler, Veecon Media and
Broadcasting recorded # loss of Re 37 lakh ($51,800) an FY16, down from Rs 1.3
crore [~$182,C00) in FY17.A
7s, The only other time Veecon ever truly surfaced in the media before Harvest TV :
\ was when, seemingly out of nowhere, Veecon Media and Television ia sister .
company of Veecon Media and Sroadcast:ng! swooped in to buy Anil Ambani-led
Reliance Communications&€™ OTH business in November 2017. After initially flying
solo on the deal, Veecon Media and Television would later partner with Pante)
Technologies. Sut despite media reports claiming a deal was imminent, it never
actually came to fruition. A Veecon Media spokesperson confirmed that the
company had pulled out of the deal, leaving Pantel the sole-owner ef the DTH
business. Messages and calis to Pantel chairman and managing director Vijender
Singh went unanswered. Incidentally, Pantel&e™s Vijender Singh is also an ,

Ever since Harvest TV4€"s Launch on 26 January, # swall, Kerala-based Christian
devotionsl TV network has been on edge. she networks€™s name? Narvest Television ‘
Network Private Limited, more commonly krown as Harvest TV. Operational since
2013, the network owns nine Hacvest trademarks and four TV channels. Its name,
though, is no coincidence.
In 2016, Veecon and Harvest Television Network allegedly entered into a
memorandum of understanding {MoU}. According to the MoU, says Siji Bibi George.
director at Harvest Television Network, Harvest would lend its logo and neme to
the TV licence of Veecon through a no-objection certificate (NOC). George says
that Veecon later terminated the MoU. The reason given by Veecon, says George,
y was thet it had d€udifferent business plans&€>. George also shared a copy of :
this termination noticese“dated 23 September 20178€"with The Ken, however, we
were unable to independently verify its authenticity. Veeconaems Cnoudhry denied
any such MoU was real. However, the Veecon spokespersor acknowledged its
existence, going so far as to say that Veecon cancelled the MoU when it realised
that S@aHarvest TV Network converts Hindus to Christiansé€>.

If you are an Airtel OTH subscriber, youde™ll be eble to see two channels that

1té€™s not that Veecon is not ready to rebrand. The company is waiting on the \
16B ministry to approve izs name change application. After Veecon terminated its
MoU with Harvest, it moved the 148 ministry to get the channel name changed to ‘
adeuTiranga TVa€*. That application has collected dust for over a year now.

Harvest Television Network makes no mention of a Uiweline regarding che use of

Veecon Media has also moved the Telecom Disputes Setclement and Appellate
Tribunal {TOSAT) against the Union of India to push the name change through.
Interestingly enough, one of the ettorneys for Veecon Media in the TDSAT case is

News channels in India atraggle to make money. This is particularly true for
English news channels, which account for less then 1% of the total news
viewership in India. Regional and Hind: news channels manage to survive by
Leveraging their vast audience bases and keeping costs low. A

independen: media consultant and former vice-chairmar of Times Giobal

to pinpoint as most media companies group multiple channels under a single
entity, and the cost of investment can vary, depending on the scale a channel

Vesconat™s original plan was to launch a Hindi news channel (after the current
English channel), followed by regional cnea. To do so, Veecon would need « lot

3/27/19, 10:40 PM - Vikas Aidem: Today, minutes after 6:45pm REPUBLIC BHARAT in
@ massive SUPER EXCLUSIV? was the FIRST to access and air the footage that India
was waiting for with bated breath-- the foctage of the A-SAT liftoff into space
that broadcast to the world that India has the capability of eliminating the
enemy even in outer apace. On a day that India became a superpower in space, it
gives me immense pride to say that REPUBLIC MEDIA WETWORK was the FIRST to beam
to ite viewers in homes across Indie the momentous mozent in history-- in both
Hindi and English. True to our core of journalism for the people, the pre,
during and liftoff footage brought every Indian into that historic moment and
oN made them pact of it forever. REPUBLIC MEDIA NETWORK was the only news network
~ to be able to get the footage EXCLUSIVELY and broedcast it less than 8 hours
after the l:fc-off. When the world wes looking at India in anticipation and awe '
of what this great nation had just created indigenousiy, REPUBLIC MEDIA WETWORK
was the FIRST co put out the footage-- from the countdown announcements to the
visual delignt of the plumes of smoke as the missile litted and proceeded to its
target. fven while others were content in the reportage on just the political
squabbling, REPUBLIC MEDIA XETWORK broke through the cacophony and ensured
elevation of discourse by bringing its viewers the reality. It gives me pride to
say that, once again, when India witnessed a landmark moment when an Indian-made
missile had done only what 3 other countries had ever achieved, REPUBLIC MEDIA :
NETWORK was at the forefront of ensuring that our deep journalism connected each
one of the 1.3 billion Indians with the glory that they deserve to feel when
they see the footage of [ndiaé€™s achievement.

dated 29.05.2019 in Sroadcasting Appeal Wo 2 of 2018 in Bennett Coleman 6 Co. t
Ltd & Anz. Ve TRAIT and connected matters. ,
2. The TOSAT has vide its Judgment only discussed the power and authority of '
TRA to issue directions dated 03.12.2918 to restrain the broadcasters and
distributors of television channels from placing any registered satellite
television channel whose TV rating ia re:eased by TV rating agency, on the :
Landing Logical Channel Number (LCN} or Landing Channel or Soot-up screen. The ,
[DSAT rendered @ considered Judgment that impugned directions are beyond the b
provisions of the TRAIT Act to issue directions and accordingly quashed the
Direction/Order dated 03.12.2016 passed by TRAI. }
3. The TOSAT, during the course of hearing, had issued Notice to BARC despite
which it has not appeared before the TDSAT. However, based on the materials on
record, following are the relevant pares which pertains to existing methodology
adopted by BARC. A perusal of the same goes to show that there was no reason as

enh... TRAL has indicated that the concerned agency has ruled out possibility
of neutralising the influence of landing LCw on television ratings by auitably
changing the method of measurement because it was not possible due to technical
limitationsa€;..a€* ,
Para 14 @ Page 14
'
Steh€:. Lastiy, it has been submitted that even if it was proved that distortion
in TRE is appreciable ard requires some remedial action, al) the alternate
options should have been sought from specialised agencies including BARC and
then an informed decision should have been taken in # transparent manner 80 85
to cause minimum injury to the stakeholders, particularly, the
distributors/MS$0s. It was also submitted that BARC is an agency representing 60%
TD broadcasters, 200 advertisers and 20% advertising agencies end if BARC hes any .
. Problems re:ating to TRP, it should be allowed to take initiative for remedies
of the problem is genuine. Ic has also been submitted that since BARC has not
taken sny such initiative, it must be presumed that none of the stake holders in
BARC are adversely affected to any material extent and on this ground also the
impugned directions ere arbitrary and unreasonable. &¢+
Para 23 @ Page 19
@tnit:.. However, we do know that the Authority has applied sufficient energy
and diligence in addressing technical problems faced by BARC since BARC did not
wish to change its methodology keeping in view the incernational best practices.
Mo one can have cavil vith following best practices. Hovever, we do not known
what are the best international practices in respect of landing page or in
respect of regulation of LCNs in general ace
4. It is pertinent to note that the TOSAT records <n para 19 thet BARC did not
wish to change its methodology keeping in view the international best practices.
The TDSAT, apart from recording the aforesaid, had no occasion to comment upon !
oO the methodology adopted by BARC or direct BARC to change its methodology of i
calculating TAP. :
s. In view of this, { see no order cr direction or reason for BARC to change .

The catchy headline was not supported with enough certent on the Program. There
is no detail on what to expect from the program, what would be subjects/ topics
covered, which platforms would be used for training and demonstration. It looked
like we were using fancy buzzwords to support wery theoretical approach. We have
enough suck material on Google search

subscribers had to call up and get the channels activated...TataSky had done
this on 29 Nov evening so that their subscribers report as on 30 November shows 1
lesser active subs of Sony channels...that benefited Tata Sky bcoz they were
paying Sony channels on per subscriber basis after the negotiations
fatled...from lst December moat of Sony channels were back...from yesterday now

12/27/18, 1:52 PW - Rushabn Rajesh Nehta: Sir...this is an appeal by LCO to
subscribers... '
The advertisements on pay television channels abt new rules are misleading to b
subscribers. Earlier abt 400-500 channe.s were delivered to subscrivers for
Ra.250-350. As per new government rules, new subscr.bers will hv to buy separate
bouquets from every broadcaster. Price of the famous and important pay channels
hv increased from As.1C to Rs. 19.
For 100 channels, subscribers will hv to pay compulsory 28.130. Also additional
damage bcoz of GST. Now onwards for As.250-350, subscribers will get only abt 25
channels whereas earlier you wexe ting 400 channels for the same price.

12/29/18, 5:07 OM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Sir...I am hearing one wore rumour...
donde™t know how true it is but there might b some truth as well...
‘
The protest in Star office was orchestrated...there is a hint where Ster after
loosing case against TRA: in Supreme Court... somehow wanted to derail the
Tariff order... LCOs were galvanised to protest by Staz only in Mumbai ... 1
protest of LCOs in Star office was en eye wash so thas no one can blame Star...
why did LCCs only protest against Star and no other broadcaster...also LCOs knew :
abt the Tariff order but ressined quite for all this while...most MSOs are in
favour of NTO, so LCOs going against MSO is also surprising...shal. try to dig
out more info on this
12/29/18, $:14 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Star is telling LOOs that we fought
oN NTO only for the benefit of smaller LCOs... Star was always against it... now if

especially on Airtel
4) Mr. Gupte said that NSOs were cooperating on NTO whereas OTH operators were
not
$) to which Airtel responded that OTH operates in a prepaid model hence it is
difficult tc reach out to consumers who are not sharing their preferences...on

collecting monthly subscription, he can ask the subscriber to share his
OC preferences 1
6) Dish TV claimed 35% subs migrated to NTO, Hathway claimed 354%, Siticable
claimed 40% migration, Den claimed 30-35% migration

2/11/19, 12:54 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehte: BASE PACK CHARGE: TRAI sets up call
center for complaints, gives phone no. 0120 a€" 6998689 or e-mail at
das@trai.gov.in
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has issued new directions to cable and
DTH operators prohibiting them from forcing eny channe. other thar
Doordarsharaée™s on their consumers in the name of &€°base packs&€™ or &€ basic
service tierae™, and eleao set up a call center to desl with such complaints.
The move comes in the wake of hundreds of complaints on social media from
consumera that their many DTH and cable operators are simply refusing to allow
users to edit or change their base paccs.
Instead, consumers have complained, these cable and CTH operators are telling
their custoxers that the &€ base pack#€™ cannot be changed and that any pack
they add will be over and above this. !
f
© S@uThe Authority has been informed that some service providers are pushing '
certain pactages, not allowing choice within first 1CO channels, providing :
certain FTA channels irrespective of consumer&€™s options etc. The Authority has
taken a note of such issues and has directed the diatribution platform operators .
to follow the regulation in letter and spirit.
AaéuThe consumer choice and paying only for what the consumer wishes to watch, 19
the power, the new framework gives to subscribers. The subscribers are free to '
choose Free to Air chenne.s and / or pay channels either on a-lacarte or in the \
form of bouquet or any combination thereof, even within the first one hundred
channels,a@¢ it said. |
TRAL also gave @ phone number and email 10 for consumers to register their !
compleints about any such errant behavior by their cable or DTH operator.

&@€uIn case any DIN / Cable Operator is insisting on predefined pack or bouquets
without providing real choices, subscribers may report the seme at TRAI call
centre 0120 8€* 6898689 or e-mail at das@trai.gov.in,&€* it added. .
Under the rules, the base pack is supposed to be a@-editableae™. In other words,
any consumers should be able to log on to the website of the cable or DTH
operator ard remove any channel from his base pack or add any new ehannel to it.
Such a swapping of channel will not have any impact on the network charges ‘
payable by the consumer to the cable or DTH service.
However, many cable and OTK companies aze learnt to have struck deals with :
certain channel owners to push their channels to consumers in a mandatory
fashion, without giving the consumer the choice to turn their channels off. .
&@nSubscribers may note that the new regime empowers them to change their
choices whenever they desire. They can add channels for @ sonth or for aultiple
~ months whenever a program of their choice is broadcast, thereby providing
“> sufficient flexibility. The subscribers can always request their service
. provider to modify (add or delete) their selection, even after choosing any
package at present. All the subscribers are requested to choose wisely and
select those channels that they wish to actually watch, &€* TRAI added.

transaission.

oO These angry users went to their local cable operators, and things turned nasty. :

diffuse the situation. :

1/22/19, 9:22 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mette: Hello Sir, Sony had confirmed on email
last week that they wod subscribe to PrimaVU. Today 1 met Commercia. Head Hr.
Raa} Gupta, so that we can expedite the paperwork process.
Even after 1.5 hours of detsiled conversation, he remained edamant asking for
some form of bargain either as discount on PrimaVu or some freebies with respect
yy to any other product, for him to sign on the dotted line.
As he is the Commercial Head, he might delay the process, which is already a
closed deal in a way.
So was thinking if I can offer him s combo deal of PrimaVU + Bio Nusic at price
point of 68 of me subscription for PrimaVU (abt Rs.1.65 crores} and additional
Re.10 lacs for 6 music channels for Bio Music. Zarlier for Bio Music we had
quoted Rs.20 lacs for 6 channels (but finally they didnae=: go forward).
This combo deal might help us get a sale for both the products. . -Requesting for

We had requested Derrick to attend todayS€™s meeting, in order to address their
Universe size concern.
Anuradha is not convinced with the Universe size. She feels the size is too
small to benefit any stakeholder. She said she will also spk to Advertiser
fraternity about their interest in PrimaVU. She remarked that the universe SARC
is quoting is similer to Netflix user base right now and said why wiil
advertisers be interested in targeting such a small universe and that too at
Household level. ‘
She said that instead of subscribing PrimaVU TV as &€"currency&e™, they will
prefer to use it for qualitative research, to conduct questionnaires and know ;
their choices. More than TV behaviour she is interested in knowing Digita!
behaviour (which we could pitch with our TV+Digital product).

Mumbai. There has been no change in distribution; so we are unsure about the
reason for this decline. Impact of competition (if any) should have resuited in .
@ decline in engagement and not reach
Decline in wx 40 (Navratri) &@* We would like to understand the reason for the
highest decline for SP as compared to other channels
This year SP showed a decline from 189 (wk 39) A 174 GRPs (wk 40) A 165 GRPs
(wk 41}. The decline has continued for 2 weeks; while, other channels have not :
shown this Level of decline across the 2 veeks !
Even in 2018 (removing the impact of Dance+ launch week), Star Plus would have
been 196 GRPs (from 202 GAPs! which was only a 3% drop as compared co the 6%
this time. 2017 also saw a fall of 6% {from 161 to 171) which is cower than this \
yeartes fal.
This decline does not match the Tata Sxy trend: ,
Wk 41 showed a 6X f2)1 as compared to SP (SP: 140 A 143 GRPs, Sony: 100 A 160
GRPs) '
However on BARC, Sony remained consistent ( 195 Gaps A 194 GAPs) walle Star
Plus fell from 174 A 165 GRPs. i
